# Cyberpunk 2077 Tarot

> Tarot card, archetype, knowledge held in symbolic form, a stage in your journey thorugh life - take your pick.
One pick is, as Misty calls it "message from higher power"

-- CDPR.

It is done in a diegetic way as to not break immersion even though it does it to the 4th wall.
CDPR is the all-knowing creator and these are subtle messages, symbols, nudges or just plain informative bits that may
help you get the most of your game.

## The Why

It is simply to give you the opportunity of an informed decision, and of course - food for thought.
Just adds more dept to the game, the experience, even if you don't spend too much time analyzing and overanalyzing them.
At the very least, you'd have a nice mission of going around the city, "collecting" those cards.

This is important, if you want to get a bit more out of those tarot cards, you should not go around the city and
cross it off your active missions. This has something to do with the other active main story missions you are doing,
the characters and/or places you're interacting with, and most importantly, the decisions you make.

So, the best way to play this tarot game is organically, as you move through the rest of the game. You simply notice
why you are there and who you are interacting with. Which brings us to...

## Who, Where and When

Some players think the tarot cards represent specific characters in game, which might be true in some cases, like
_The Fool_ is literally spelled out to be you (V). But it's not so. Not in te most literal sense.

You see, at one point, Misty does tell you _The Fool_ is V, but V from the start of the game, not the one in front
of her having their cards read. And this is not such a big leap. Characters represent some concepts, some ideas,
tarots are that as well in a symbolic form.

So, sometimes those ideas will be connected to some characters that symbolize ideas/concepts, other times to places
that do that and most often they are there to guide your decisions, so when you see them it is most likely when you
might be making an important decision story-wise, that might move your experience towards one direction or another.

You should also keep in mind, the locations aren't always indicative of characters. This is so because of real estate.
The game, in its early stages of prologues and act 1 is constrained to a small space. Because of this, if the
locations were supposed to directly be linked to characters, well some of the cards might have to be places right
next to each other.

As an example, if _The Fool_ is V and _The Magician_ is Johnny, you'd have to see both next to V's
apartment door. Not impossible, but not as good playing experience. So, _The Magician_ is in front of Lizzy's Bar,
which had led some to speculate it represents Evelyn or Judy. It doesn't, it represents concepts, so it might as well be
all 3 characters if you find them share in the same concept, the same idea or story beat. It's most likely Johnny
though, it's easier if you put a face to an idea, right?

Another thing of note is if a card is reversed or not. You might get _The Chariot_ twice by Misty, once normal and once
reversed. _The Chariot_ can mean the same concept - change, but it can be good or bad, so it's a more straightforward
reading.

Here there are two interpretations from Misty's readings:

> [before meeting Takemura] The reverse chariot reveals that such danger is tied to your love of risk. Do not aim too high V

> [after Playing for time] The Chariot. You're ready for change, ready to seek the truth about yourself. And to help, you'll have... Someone from you family?

And here are the characters it will relate to: Jackie, Takemura, Judy, Panam, Johnny, Rogue. 
But, as you might decide to see it, the chariot may as well be V, the one that is dragged through the story by those characters.
You are the chariot, you are being lead by their specific stories and thus shape your own story through the game.


Another way to interpret is based on concepts related to the card itself.
The Moon, as an example, she's cold and distant even though bright and light. It is suggested it has cold logic, but funnily enough, 
Luna is also where people in the past have taken the word lunatic from.
When she calls, the two wolves (V+J?) howl. Arasaka? Corpos? The promise of a "cure" whatever it may be?

Reversed can also mean the opposite in a non-literal sense, but a context, due to timing or other circumstance.
As an example, Misty might pull _The World_ which represents your game, the open world. I mean, the part of the game you
have the most agency. Then just as you're about to pick an ending, Misty might show you _The World_ reversed, meaning
it's the end of the agency, you pick the drawing and from there on you're just coloring within those lines.

After I've gone through some takes on the web, from Reddit comments, I did make my own Excel table to make sense of
it all and as soon as I had most of the picture, I did watch a video that mostly agrees with
mine https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPiSU4iFfxA
with some exceptions, but also, it may expose viewers to future story beats, if they haven't played through it all.
